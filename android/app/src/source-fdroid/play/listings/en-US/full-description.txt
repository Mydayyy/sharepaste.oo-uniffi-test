This app allows you to quickly share text, in such a way that the hosting server can't read contents of the paste you have shared.
Or in other words, your share is end to end encrypted. You can also set your paste to auto destruct 💣 after a set duration. 
Or burn on read 🔥 (Mission Impossible style!) if you like, to prevent unintended persons from accessing it later.

If you know of PrivateBin, this is the first and only mobile client for it that we know of :)

Enjoy sharing your pastes privately!


Built with love 🫶, Kotlin 🏝️  and Rust 🦀.
